CANA Classic is an unaged hand-crafted Brazilian Cachaça [pronounced ka•sha•sa]. Made in a Brazil by our master blender Vicente Ribeiro, a 2nd generation producer and owner of Soledade Farm. Our proprietary blend is distilled three times and filtered through coconut husk charcoal. This creates an elegant taste profile, with balanced taste, hints of flowers & tropical fruit on the nose, and a soft, hint of honey taste with a long finish.
