Title: Art for Justice

----

Text:

The project Art for Justice emerged as a means to partner with artists from our community and mobilize donations towards organizations that fight for racial justice.

*The Prize*
Donated by Cãna, the Winner will receive one (1) limited edition print of the original photo by famous Brazilian photographer, Demian Jacob.

*How does it work? *
1. Make a donation of $20 or more.
2. Each $20 entry counts as a chance to win the Limited Edition print. There is no limit to how much you can donate. More entries, more chances to win. 
3. The winner will be announced on the @drinkcana page on June 17th at noon. 

The idea is to support these organizations, if you have already donated forward us the receipt to hi@drinkcana.com and we'll add you to the drawing.

$20 = 1 entry
$40 = 2 entries
$60 = 3 entries
$80 = 4 entries

Winners will be announced on June 17th 2020.

*Who you'll help*
The Art for Equality initiative was launched by Cãna to raise awareness and funds in support of racial justice. 100% of the proceeds go directly to the NAACP.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is a civil rights organization in the United States, formed in 1909 as a bi-racial endeavor to advance justice for African Americans. 

*Winner Confirmation Process*
Following the campaign closure date, we'll use an automated random drawing process to draw the potential winner for the campaign. A confirmation process will then take place to ensure the potential winner meets the legal standards required. Pending a positive confirmation process, a Cãna team member will notify the winner and share the announcement publicly on the week of June 15th, 2020.

**Must be 18 or older to participate.**
