Title: Cãna Classic Caipirinha

----

Text:

2 oz Cãna Classic Cachaça
1 lime
0.5 oz lime juice
2 tbsp of white or brown sugar

Glass - Old Fashioned
Garnish - None

Cut lime into 8 pieces. In a shaker, add 6 pieces, the sugar, and the lime juice. Muddle, pressing each piece. Add the Cãna, shake with ice. Dump into old fashioned glass. No garnish, just drink and repeat. You'll be having fun in no time.

Kitchen Hack: These are so tasty, you'll want to have multiple. So save some time and make 4 in one go, by using a jar and quadrupling the recipe.
