Title: Watermelontini

----

Text:

2 oz Cãna Classic Cachaça
0.5 oz simple syrup
0.25 oz St Germain
1 oz fresh watermelon juice

Glass - Coupe
Garnish - Watermelon Slice

Shake all ingredients with ice, then strain into a chilled coup. Garnish with a watermelon slice. Enjoy! 

Kitchen Hack: Don't use a martini glass, it's uber-messy and annoying to clean. Plus, a coupe is much classier ;)
