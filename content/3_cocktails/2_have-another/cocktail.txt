Text:

1 oz Cãna Classic Cachaça 
1 oz orange juice (fresh preferred)
0.5 oz lime juice (fresh preferred) 
4 oz lemon soda
Bushel of mint

Glass - Wine
Garnish - Mint

Shake Caña, orange juice, and lime juice with ice. Strain into a wine glass filled with fresh ice and top with lemon soda. Gently smack mint and place on top. 

Kitchen Hack: Fresh orange juice is recommended. Fresh lime juice is a must. Experiment with different soda flavors/garnishes. Orange juice topped with grapefruit soda and a basil leaf mmmmm.
