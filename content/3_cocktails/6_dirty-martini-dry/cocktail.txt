Title: Dirty Brazilian Martini

----

Text:

2 oz Cãna Classic Cachaça
0.5 oz dry vermouth
0.5 oz olive brine liquid

Glass - Coupe
Garnish - 3 olives on a skewer

Stir all ingredients over ice for 20 seconds, then strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with skewered olives. *Live dangerously.*

Kitchen Hack: We recommend a coupe glass and not a martini glass because no one likes martini glasses - they spill - a lot.
