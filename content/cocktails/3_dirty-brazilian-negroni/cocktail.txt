Title: Brazilian Negroni

----

Text:

1 oz of Cãna Classic Cachaça
1 oz of Campari (or Aperol)
1 oz dry vermouth

Glass - Rocks
Garnish - Orange Peel

Stir all ingredients over ice for 20 seconds. Strain into a rocks glass filled with ice. Rim the glass with the orange peel, and twist into the drink to garnish.

Kitchen Hack: Using Aperol will result in a sweeter drink, meaning easier sipping on a hot, fun afternoon. Campari is more bitter; perfect for a late night slow sipper.
