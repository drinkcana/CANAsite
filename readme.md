CANA Website
====================

Built on kirby (www.getkirby.com), placed here so we can collaborate across Brazil & US

# Details

There are a couple things to remember:
1. Don't forget .htaccess file, otherwise some weird bugs happen
2. This is database-less which is great (thank @getkirby !) but that means pay attention to the documentation
3. It has userfiles currently, if you want it, make sure you delete the site>accounts file it will regenarate
