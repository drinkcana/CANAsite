  <p>
    Cachaça, pronounced [KA•SHA•SA], is one of the oldest spirits in the world. It’s the drink shared by all Brazilians, from the cattle ranchers on the rolling hills of the countryside, to a hardworking office worker in downtown, to the party-goer in an underground club. </p>
  
  <p>It is beloved by all, regardless of occupation or class. This spirit is the bridge that has brought different communities together since ancient times, allowing new friendships to blossom through a shared passion. </p>

  <p>Cachaça shares its main ingredient with rum; sugar cane. However, unlike rum, which uses the black byproduct and leftovers of making sugar, cachaça uses fresh sugar cane juice. This juice is what gives cachaça its flavorful & elegant body.

  <p>
   Our story started with two longtime friends, a designer and an entrepreneur, two lovers of cachaca. Set to the backdrop of a New York dinner (evening?) among friends (is it too repetitive). We found ourselves on the hunt for a bottle of our favorite spirit from home: Cachaça [pronounced ka•sha•sa]. </p>
   <p> What we found was lackluster, it didn’t capture the essence of Brazil the way we saw it. A Brazil that is genuine, full of richness, cultural movements, and diversity. We wanted a product we were proud to give to our friends. So we decided to make our own. 
This is how CÃNA was born.
